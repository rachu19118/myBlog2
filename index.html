    <h1> My First Console Project </h1>
    <p> Visual Studio is a great place to code. You first get into the place by going to the home page and finding a blue logo that says Visual Studio Code, and then you create a coding folder. After that, you open the folder onto Visual Studio. Finally, get the HTML file by clicking the first icon next to the folder name, and then typing index.html in the folder </p>
    <p> The console screen is useful to help learn Javascript because it is very complicated. We can't memorize everything in Javascript, so we can show what we know on the Console screen to make sure everything is correct. Then we can make sure that there are not any mistakes made.</p>
    <script>
        console.log("Hi I am console screen");
        var first_name="Rahul";
        console.log(first_name);
        var last_name="Mukherjee";
        console.log(last_name);
        var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(full_name);
        var a = 10;
        var b = 5;
        var add = a + b;
        console.log(add)
        var subtract = a - b;
        console.log(subtract)
        var multiply = a * b;
        console.log(multiply)
        var divide = a / b;
        console.log(divide)
